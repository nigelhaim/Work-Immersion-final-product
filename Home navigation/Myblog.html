					<h1>The Internet</h1>
					<p>The rise of the Internet has changed the way people communicate with one another. Long distance interaction that bypasses racial & geographical boundaries is now made possible through the technology we have developed today for communication. These include smartphones, computers, Internet, social media etc. Communication has come a long way since the days when people only had telephones and handwritten letters to communicate with those in a long distance away from the sender that isnâ€™t instantaneous compared to our technology today. While we can still view this as a positive thing where we can share and interact, it can also have worrying effects on our social interaction. As stated earlier, the inception of social media & the technology related to it has made communication with others relatively easier.

				<h1>EQUALITY AND UNITY IN CULTURAL DIVERSITY </h1>
				<p>
Understanding Culture, Society, and Politics is tantamount to understanding, recognizing, and accepting the people, for what they are, where they came from, and how they think. To be fairly honest, never have I ever been interested in a subject in my life up until I met UCSP. This subject made things clearer to me. For starters, I know that culture is the first thing that makes a society diverse. People have different cultural backgrounds, different heritage, and different races.
