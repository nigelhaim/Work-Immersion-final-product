Society is a complex structure since different people have their perspectives, actions, and interactions. Different backgrounds and cultures exist from other countries. Human development comes from "actions" and "interactions" from different humans. Changing one's perspective through interaction could help that specific person grow. He or she learns from other people's actions and could observe its outcomes specifically in moral terms. Our way of life is changing through our interactions on social media. People could express their thoughts more freely and independently. Social media connects us more than ever before. Within seconds of posting, any person could share information. Despite the bright side of technology, only a few people study the other side of the coin. This innovation also opens up new problems. Cyberbullying and sharing offensive posts can be one of the major issues in online interaction. Social media like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and other online platforms could help people build-up or break down another person's reputation and perspective. A Professor Emeritus in Harvard Business and the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism quoted that "Facebook concluded that they could affect real-world emotions without triggering the user's awareness." This conclusion comes from the experiment of "massive-scale contagion experiments" that is conducted by Facebook. Fake news is also a big problem in social media. 
<br><br>
A former design ethicist at Google named Tristan Harris stated: "I wish more people could understand how this works because it shouldn't be something the tech industry knows. It should be something everybody knows." This statement reminds us that freedom of speech on the web does not mean absolute freedom, and everybody could share information that might cause miscommunication and disruption. No man is invulnerable to misinformation. Even professionals still do not know how vulnerable their mind is when it comes to technology, it is a separate discipline in psychology and social studies. This discipline applies to all human beings. 
<br><br>
One of the problems with social media is it's a tool for persuasion, and it may be the greatest thing ever created. In a quote from the game called: Overwatch, one of the characters has a line that says: "Everything can be hacked, and EVERYONE." People have their own opinions and beliefs in society. Every person has their perspective in a given situation nevertheless, in today's world most people are not anymore willing to listen to other people's opinions. This is one of the main objectives in the algorithms of social media. Through your search history and interesting posts, the system organizes the articles and posts that satisfy and agrees with your perspectives and removes or filters out the information that disagrees with you. One of the first investors at Facebook and a venture capitalist says in an interview that "Each person has their facts, overtime, you have the false sense that everyone agrees with you because everyone in your news feed sounds just like you." Later in the interview, he stated that "If everyone is entitled to their facts, there is no need for people to come together and INTERACT." 
<br><br>
"FAKE NEWS!" a term states that a piece of information is not legitimate, but if social media is a platform of freedom of speech then how do you determine if that information is fake? There is an MIT study that fake news on Twitter spreads six times faster than legitimate news. Tristan quoted in an interview that "People have no idea what is true, and now it's a matter of life and death." Currently, the pandemic has affected the world in all social statuses. Some social media groups say that COVID-19 is a hoax despite the numerous facts that are concluded through continuous research. We have gone from the information age to the disinformation age. 
<br><br>
So what is our action in this problem? What could be the best solution in solving this kind of problem in an innovation? How can we change how people interact with social media? Justin Rosenstein, a former engineer at Facebook and Google. He said that "The way technology works is not a law of physics, it is not set in stone. These are choices that human beings have been making." This quote suggests that humans have the freedom to change technology. Do you want where world peace could be disrupted where you can reach any mind you want, target a lie to that specific population, and create culture wars? Humans built social media to connect, and despite these good effects we still should have the responsibility to change the unwanted effects? We can demand that these innovations can be designed humanely. Society evolves because one of its questions is "How can we make the world better?" Coordination with legitimate sources and experts on human rights is a good start in creating the better system that is built with the technology today. Society cannot eliminate the people who share misleading information, but we can filter and prioritize legitimate information.
