		Understanding Culture, Society, and Politics is tantamount to understanding, recognizing, and accepting the people, for what they are, where they came from, and how they think. To be fairly honest, never have I ever been interested in a subject in my life up until I met UCSP. This subject made things clearer to me. For starters, I know that culture is the first thing that makes a society diverse. People have different cultural backgrounds, different heritage, and different races. This is what leads us to separate views: Xenocentrism and Ethnocentrism. To think that your own culture is superior to others is something that must not be condoned. However, this view has its advantages. First, it promotes social change and second it acts as harmony in a particular group that thinks their culture is superior, in other words, it serves as a bond between people of the same view. 
		<br><br>
Culture is something that can separate us but can also unite us. Let us compare culture to us humans. We, humans, are different from one another. You don't see two perfectly identical people walking downtown. We are just all different from each other, wholly from physical appearances down to behavior, even twins have their differences. However, what unites us is our humanity. According to Vocabulary.com, humanity is what makes us human or the qualities that make us humans, and humankind is the human race. In analogy, people of the same culture and traditions are united as one because of their shared beliefs and practices. Their culture acts as a bond between them. 
<br><br>
My advocacy: Equality and Unity in Cultural Diversity aims to extend the idea of equality among different cultures because where there is equality there will always be unity. I want to see a world where people respect, accept, and acknowledge cultures that are different from theirs. According to A. Langer and G. Brown (2007), cultural status inequalities are apparent disparities in treatment, public recognition, or status of various groups' cultural norms, practices, symbols, and customs. Another example of cultural inequality is language, still, according to A. Langer and G. Brown (2007), the privilege of one or few languages over others is apparently unfair because it is favorable to and is a dominance of those who could speak the privileged language and consider it as their mother tongue.  Cultural discrimination, exclusion, and unjust treatment must be stopped. It has to be stopped. What would you feel if you are being treated poorly and see other people being treated favorably? And all of this is because of the difference in your culture? 
<br><br>
Having advocacy doesn't really mean you are going to set sail and are going to campaign in the different parts of the world, talking with a microphone in front of everyone in an open area while advocating your advocacy, no. For me, having advocacy can simply happen if you are acting on it. If you know that you are doing what you think is right and if you are fighting for it. My plan of action is to act. As simple as it is, but it can change lives. If I see a person being discriminated against because of his culture or tradition, then I will act. I will bravely talk to the people who are treating him unjustly and will report this to a nearby authority. After this, I will let him know that being discriminated against is not something he can let happen to him, people are given equal rights and so is their culture. A simple act like this is what it takes for my advocacy to come to fulfillment.
