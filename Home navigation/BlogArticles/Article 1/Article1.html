		The rise of the Internet has changed the way people communicate with one another. Long distance interaction that bypasses racial & geographical boundaries is now made possible through the technology we have developed today for communication. These include smartphones, computers, Internet, social media etc. Communication has come a long way since the days when people only had telephones and handwritten letters to communicate with those in a long distance away from the sender that isn’t instantaneous compared to our technology today. While we can still view this as a positive thing where we can share and interact, it can also have worrying effects on our social interaction. As stated earlier, the inception of social media & the technology related to it has made communication with others relatively easier. This could lead to people getting more complacent and reliant on technology to get our point across.
		<br><br>
	One of the most obvious & the closest negative effects we see that social media has on human interaction is the concept known as Virtual Distance. According to DJ Wardynski, Virtual Distance is the phenomenon where people are physically together but detached from each other due to being completely absorbed with their technological device, such as a laptop or smartphone/tablet (mobile device). This translates to couples, parents and children, and all types of other human interactions being relegated to the background while people are busy connecting with others in digital space via their technological device. This slowly erases any intimacy in our interpersonal relationships which can branch out to other effects that are as bad if not worse than losing that intimacy you have with your loved ones. In the era of technology, social media interactions now dominate both online and offline conversations. In a society where interacting and oversharing is the norm, you are probably more likely to speak to friends and family through electronic devices than face-to-face. Often at events or parties, guests are attached to their smartphones tweeting or texting, but no one is truly engaging or interacting with the people around them, as stated by Prof. Chetan R. Bhamare.
	<br><br>
	From my own experience, it’s quite easy to put down social media and talk with your loved ones. The real challenge is maintaining control over yourself to not check your phone every time you hear your notifications or feel it vibrate, and you would have to do this everyday. My tip for this is to turn all notifications off, or even better, turn mobile data/WiFi connections off your devices. Set a limit for yourself on how much social media usage you allow yourself on a daily basis. But of course, everything that I’ve said wouldn’t be made possible without my last advice. The reason I was able to strike a balance between social media and interaction with my real life connections is because I always concentrate on what really matters to me. Whenever I know that my addiction is getting stronger at a particular moment, I always go back and think to my family to save myself from going too deep into social media. And that’s all you ever need. Remember what’s important for you, and the rest will follow easily.
